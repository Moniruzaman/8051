# 8051 LED Blink (AT89C51 / AT89S51)

This is my first 8051 project.  
It runs a simple LED blink program on AT89C51 / AT89S51 and is simulated in Proteus.

## Features
- LED toggles every 500 ms
- Timer delay using software loop
- Proteus simulation included

## Hardware
- Microcontroller: AT89C51
- Clock: 11.0592 MHz crystal
- LED on P1.0 with 330 ohm resistor

## File Structure
- `src/main.c` – application code
- `hex/LED_Blink.hex` – compiled output
- `proteus/` – Proteus simulation files

## Software Tools
- Keil uVision (C51)
- Proteus 9 Professional
- GitHub for version control
